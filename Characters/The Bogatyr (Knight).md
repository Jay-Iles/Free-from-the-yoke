##Bogatyr Moves
###Against Countless Enemies
No matter the odds, you can trust in your skill with arms. Your melee weapons always have the *cleave* tag on top of anything else, and you never suffer disadvantage from being outnumbered.

###Gleaming Scale
*So long as your outfit has the Regal tag,* you can erase that tag instead of taking a flesh wound or heavy wound.

###Carry the Weight
When the need is dire, you can call on deep reserves of strength.
*When you attempt a heroic feat of strength*, roll +Might. On a 7+ you can lift something as big as a horse just enough, and for just long enough, to do what is needed. On a 10+, pick one:
* You can put what you’re carrying down with no harm to it or yourself.
* You can hurl what you’re carrying away, causing great harm to it and whatever it impacts.

###Lead the Charge
*When you charge into battle at the head of a group of allies*, both you and those that follow you roll with advantage.

###Sworn Sword
*When you begin a *duel* with someone*, answer these questions instead:
* I am fighting to protect someone else.
* I am fighting to hold true to a sworn oath.
* I am fighting to demonstrate my skill.

During the duel, you can spend 1 Hold to instantly turn an incoming Heavy Wound into a Flesh Wound, or draw a new weapon.
