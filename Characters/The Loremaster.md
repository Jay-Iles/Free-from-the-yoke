## Role Moves
### Leader
Mark when you induct your House into ancient mysteries. Say what bargain you’re trying to strike with the land. GM says what’ll happen so long as you keep making the agreed sacrifices.
### Champion
Mark when you are sent to understand a mystery, place or creature. Say three possibilities you suspect for the truth, and the GM will say which one you can rule out.
### Rogue
Mark when you realise a core part of your House’s culture is a fabrication. Say what harm the falsehood is causing - to your House or outsiders. The GM says which other faction might know the truth.
### Outsider
Mark when you seek the tutelage of a spirit of the land. Say what way you are warped by the pilgrimage in mind or body. The GM says what you’ll need to do to win the spirit’s approval.
## Loremaster Moves
### Discern Significance
When you Unearth Forgotten Lore, you can always ask 1 question in addition to your roll results. You may also pick these questions:
* Who might know more about it?
* What spirits have walked this place?
* What vision do I have about its future?
* What vision do I have about its past?

### Ancient Magic Uncovered
When you rest in the wilderness outside modern civilisation, you may spend 1 Insight to dream of ancient lore and gain 1 Vision. Spend 1 Vision to gain Advantage on Enact a Ritual, or spend 3 to Learn a Ritual from the land.

### Remembered Oaths
When you demand someone honour promises they made, do not roll Find Common Ground. Instead roll +Lore, and on a hit the land will curse them until they hold true to their oaths. Pick a curse:
* All food they eat turns to ashes and blood.
* Animals will avoid or attack them.
* All clothes finer than sackcloth will rot within hours of being worn.
* They will be afflicted by pox and warts.

On a 10+ you seize their heart. Each season that passes without them fulfilling their promise, hold 1. Spend 1 hold to deal them a flesh wound, 2 to deal them a heavy wound, 3 to kill them. Lose all hold if they fulfil the promise.

### Sage Advice
When an ally Calls for Aid, you can always respond by offering advice and rolling +Lore. If you roll a 6 or less on your aid attempt, say what you learn and gain 1 Insight.

### Traditional Remedy
The medical lore you have learned makes you an extraordinarily effective healer. Your presence counts as a Surplus for the purposes of Professional Care; if an appropriate Surplus is also present, your patient heals in days instead of weeks. 

## Death Move
There’s a particular power in death. As you die, describe the powerful and lasting Ritual you work with your final breaths.
