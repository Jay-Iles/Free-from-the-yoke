Understand the Social Order
If you can take a few days to hang around areas of populations (towns, villages) you can determine aspects of that society’s function. For each day, learn one detail:

•	Who wields the real power  

•	Where people gather to gossip and share information  

•	Who is the lynchpin of the society (the old woman everyone listens to, the cheery jester beloved by all, the tavernkeeper who is free with the ale)
