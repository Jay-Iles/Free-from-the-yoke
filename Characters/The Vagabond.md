## Role Moves
### Leader
Mark when your House’s misfortune brings them down to your level. Say what new opportunities are available if they follow your lead. GM says who feels most resentment at your House’s fall in status.
### Champion
Mark when your House needs something from the bandits, outcasts and margins of society. Say what contact you’re calling on to make introductions. GM says who’s seeking them too.
### Rogue
Mark when your House snubs people like you. Say what strength of your House your fellow unfortunates managed to hold onto; GM says what they need from you to maintain their fragile existence.
### Outsider
Mark when you set out into the world to walk your own path. Say what legends you’re chasing the truth of. GM says where in the land you might find further clues.
## Vagabond Moves
### Wretch
When you abase yourself before someone, roll +Cunning. On a 7-9 hold 1; on a 10+ hold 3. Spend your hold 1-for-1 to:
- Gain advantage to Find Common Ground with them.
- Notice something they were keeping hidden.
- Redirect their attention away from you.

### The View from Below
After a taste of life in a settlement, you learn the true shape of its society. Each day you’re there, ask the GM one:
* Who wields the real power?
* Where do folk gather to gossip and swap stories?
* Who’s the black sheep of the community?
* Who’s most generous with their charity?

### Axe Soup
When you bring something or someone precious to your House to substitute for a Surplus, roll +Cunning. On a hit, it’ll be a workable substitute, though on a 7-9 pick one:
* They have to use it immediately or lose it.
* There’s a key flaw that goes unnoticed; they gain a Need of the GM’s choice as soon as they use the Surplus.
* It doesn’t go the distance; they need to spend 1-3 Coin to make up the difference (GM’s choice).

### Happy Accidents
When you suffer harm, tell your companions how you were able to turn a similar injury into a blessing. Each of them takes fleeting advantage when they act on your tale.

### Fleet-Footed
When you try to escape a dangerous situation, roll Forge a Path with Cunning. Get Advantage on the roll if you’re Unarmored.
## Death Move
When you die, say what the travellers who know you will tell of your life and death. Going clockwise around the table, each player adds or alters one element of the tale, until the complete legend has been told.
