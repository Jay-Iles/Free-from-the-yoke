# Prepare and Provision
When your House outfits your character, they can access special tools based on their circumstances. 
Start with your Assets, adjusted based on your character’s gear move.
For each of your Surpluses, pick a relevant benefit: 

* Add a tag to a piece of gear for this mission. 
* Get as many copies of a weapon, outfit or transport as needed to outfit the whole party. 
* Add 1 to the quality of a set of Followers for this mission, or get a new set with 1 quality and an appropriate specialty. 
* Get scout's reports worth 1 Data. 

Each option can be picked multiple times.

# Weapon tags

Every house can always outfit a character with a weapon with the melee tag.

Melee: This weapon can be used to attack foes within a few yards.

Here are the extra tags you might give weapons:

* Far: This weapon can be used to attack foes within eyesight.
* Brutal: The weapon inflicts awful harm, devestating and terrifying foes.
* Silent: The weapon doesn’t draw attention to you when used.
* Hidden: Carrying this weapon won’t cause people to think you’re dangerous.
* Siege: The weapon can help bring down fortifications and army-scale defences, but it requires a group of companions with a relevant specialisation to operate and needs special transports to move it.
* Non-Lethal: The weapon doesn’t cause lasting damage and can help capture your foes.
* Many: Should you lose this weapon, you’ll have others to hand.
* Elegant: The weapon is impressive and flashy in use, and can circumvent crude defences.
* Heirloom: The weapon played a pivotal role in your House’s history. While you hold it, gain Advantage on rolls to command and convince members of your House. If you lose it and don’t recover it before we Zoom Out, your House must Hold Together.
* Weird: Something of the old lore of the land clings to the weapon, causing a particular spooky effect specific to the weapon.

# Outfit tags

Every house can always outfit a character with an outfit with either the *practical* or the *heraldry* tags.

* *Practical*: the outfit is unremarkable but can be easily repaired.
* *Heraldry*: the outfit displays your house affiliation boldly.

Here are the other tags you might give outfits:

* *Regal*: the outfit is impressive and eye-catching.
* *Subtle*: the outfit helps you avoid notice. If you have cover or do not move, you will not be seen.
* *Hardy*: the outfit helps you resist the elements - it negates disadvantage from cold, rain or dangerous weather, and gives you 1 armour when those deal harm to you.
* *Tough*: the outfit is reinforced against physical blows. It negates disadvantage stemming from physical impacts - hail, landslide, suppressing fire, etc - and gives you 1 armour when you take physical harm.
* *Meditative*: the outfit helps you centre yourself and focus your thoughts. It negates disadvantage stemming from distraction, intrusive thoughts and hauntings, and gives you 1-armour when those deal damage to you.
