# Prepare and Provision
When your House outfits your character, they can access special tools based on their circumstances. 
Start with your Assets, adjusted based on your character’s gear move.
For each of your Surpluses, pick a relevant benefit: 

* Add a tag to a piece of gear for this mission. 
* Get as many copies of a weapon, outfit or transport as needed to outfit the whole party. 
* Add 1 to the quality of a set of Followers for this mission, or get a new set with 1 quality and an appropriate specialty. 
* Get scout's reports worth 1 Insight. 

Each option can be picked multiple times.

# Weapon tags

Every house can always outfit a character with a weapon with the melee tag.

Melee: This weapon can be used to attack foes within a few yards.

Here are the extra tags you might give weapons:

* Far: This weapon can be used to attack foes within eyesight.
* Brutal: The weapon inflicts awful harm, devestating and terrifying foes.
* Silent: The weapon doesn’t draw attention to you when used.
* Hidden: Carrying this weapon won’t cause people to think you’re dangerous.
* Siege: The weapon can help bring down fortifications and army-scale defences, but it requires a group of companions with a relevant specialisation to operate and needs special transports to move it.
* Non-Lethal: The weapon doesn’t cause lasting damage and can help capture your foes.
* Many: Should you lose this weapon, you’ll have others to hand.
* Elegant: The weapon is impressive and flashy in use, and can circumvent crude defences.
* Heirloom: The weapon played a pivotal role in your House’s history. While you hold it, gain Advantage on rolls to command and convince members of your House. If you lose it and don’t recover it before we Zoom Out, your House must Hold Together.
* Weird: Something of the old lore of the land clings to the weapon, causing a particular spooky effect specific to the weapon.
* Cleave: The weapon lets you fight at full effect even when outnumbered.

# Outfit tags

Every house can always outfit a character with an outfit with either the *practical* or the *heraldry* tags.

* *Practical*: the outfit is unremarkable but can be easily repaired.
* *Heraldry*: the outfit displays your house affiliation boldly.

Here are the other tags you might give outfits:

* *Regal*: the outfit is impressive and eye-catching.
* *Subtle*: the outfit helps you avoid notice. If you have cover or do not move, you will not be seen.
* *Hardy*: the outfit helps you resist the elements - it negates disadvantage from cold, rain or dangerous weather, and gives you 1 armour when those deal harm to you.
* *Tough*: the outfit is reinforced against physical blows. It negates disadvantage stemming from physical impacts - hail, landslide, suppressing fire, etc - and gives you 1 armour when you take physical harm.
* *Meditative*: the outfit helps you centre yourself and focus your thoughts. It negates disadvantage stemming from distraction, intrusive thoughts and hauntings, and gives you 1-armour when those deal damage to you.
* *Mobile*: You can move freely in the outfit, allowing athletic and acrobatic movements.
* *Utility*: Pockets and carry-loops let you carry far more than you otherwise would.

# Transport tags
In Free From the Yoke, your transport will have one of three tags:

* Mount - An animal ridden by its passenger(s). Capable of intelligent and independent action, but can carry small loads.
* Drawn - A cart, wagon or sled drawn by animals. Slower than a mount and requiring a trained driver, but can carry larger loads.
* Ship - A vessel made to travel river, lake or sea. Both fast and able to transport large loads, but restricted in where it can travel.

In addition, your transport may pick up these tags:
* Durable: The transport is resistant to harm. Gain advantage when you Defuse with it by enduring or powering through danger.
* Luxury: The transport is opulent and impressive. Time spent travelling on it counts as rest for the purposes of healing times.
* Swift: The transport is nimble and rapid. Gain advantage when you Defuse with it by evading danger and acting fast.
* Mighty: The transport can be used as a weapon (tags: Melee, Brutal). Gain Advantage when you Fiercely Assault a smaller-scale foe with it. 
* Hulking: The transport is much larger than other transports of its kind. It can carry many more passengers or cargo, but its size can make it slower and more cumbersome.
* Canny: The transport is much better able to control its movements than others of its kind. If it’s a Mount, it gains Quality 1 and a specialism (see Followers). If it’s Drawn or a Ship, it gains the same ability to control its own movements as a Mount.
