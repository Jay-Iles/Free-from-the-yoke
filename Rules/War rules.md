# Cry Havok
When you meet another army in battle, remove one of these fates for each relevant Surplus you have nearby:
* You will lose the majority of your soldiers.
* Your VIPs will suffer harm or misfortune.
* You will be forced to retreat.
* You will lose access to a crucial resource.
* You will be party to a horrific crime.
* You will lose the respect of your followers.

Your opponent - the GM or another player - should do the same.

Once you’ve mustered, it’s time for battle. Starting with the party with most Grasp, take a turn to declare what your army is doing, and then either:
* Announce your surrender.
or
* Pick one of their remaining fates and make it true if they do not surrender.
(E.g. ‘surrender now or you will be party to a horrific crime’).

Keep going until one side surrenders.
(Note that if a side has all of its fates either removed or come true, their opponent has no choice but to surrender.)
