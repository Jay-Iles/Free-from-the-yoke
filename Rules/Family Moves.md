# Intro
While it’s easy to imagine what a character can do to trigger their moves, the actions families take can be more amorphous and vague. These moves are here to set out how, exactly, families use their resources to act in the world.
If you’re having difficulty imagining what family moves being used look like in-story or at your table, the key is that they abstract out multiple smaller efforts:
1. Someone decides something needs to happen.
2. They convince other family members to help do it.
3. Various agents of the family work on the problem according to their own skills.
4. Agents return to the family and report on how the effort went.
Your character’s often the initiator in step 1, step 2’s what triggers a move, step 3 resolves the move, and step 4 ties things back to the fiction.

# Hold Together
When your Family must resist hardship, temptation or infighting, roll +Mood. On a hit you mostly remain OK; pick 1.
* You lose people to harm and/or desertion. Get Need: recruits.
* Another Family or Faction came through to help you out. Give them 1 Treaty on you.
* The danger hasn’t passed so much as shifted into a different, more manageable problem. Say what it is.
On a 10+ you are brought close together by the trial; gain Surplus: Morale in addition to the above results.

This is a general-purpose response to your family encountering adversity. The more resources you have to draw on, the better you do; the more needs sapping your strength, the worse it goes. 

This is where you’ll most clearly see the effects of your surpluses and needs, and you’re encouraged to highlight specific ones when describing how you succeed or fail.

# Conduct Diplomacy
When you call on your Family’s allies, say what you want from them:
* A meeting with one of their VIPs.
* Access to a tightly-guarded location or item.
* Information on an opportunity or threat.
Roll +Reach. On a hit, you get what you wanted and 1 Data. On a 7-9, your agents had to get help from a third party. Say which of your allies helped them seal the deal, and give them 1-Treaty on you.

This is your main tool for getting information about the world. If you’re curious about what’s happening in the weird marsh on the far side of the homeland, if you really want to know why the Amber Skulls have been hassling your couriers, if you want to see the reactor powering your neighbouring settlement, this is the move for you.
Be wary of the costs; if you get a 7-9 you owe a debt to your allies for getting the deal you needed, and any hit has the extra cost that the people who gave you the information or access know that you were looking for it. If the Amber Skull’s leader mysteriously dies or that reactor shuts down at the worst possible time, fingers will point at you.
Also note that the first two options are great chances to jump to the character level. Once your family agents are meeting someone important or investigating an item, you can zoom in and play the scene out in detail.

## Examples: Conduct Diplomacy

# Claim by Force
When you direct your Family to seize or maintain control of a resource, roll +Grasp. On a hit it’s theirs, but not without cost. 
On a 7-9 choose two of these; on a 10+, choose one:
* You need to commit more assets to securing it. Tie one of your surpluses to the resource – if you lose the resource, you lose the surplus and vice versa.
* There is a cost to your victory. Your family gets a need of the GM’s choice.
* You hurt someone; the GM will say who, and they get 2-Treaty on you.
	 
This doesn’t need to be through physical means; you can trigger it by hacking into someone’s network and taking their data for yourself. The important thing is that once you’ve acted it’s clear that you are the ones in control of the resource.

## Examples: Claim by Force

# Subterfuge
When your Family infiltrates other factions, say what they try to do:
* They make a resource appear more or less desirable.
* They cause a scandal within a Family’s/Faction’s organisation.
* They hide your own involvement in an action; you may frame someone else in their place if you wish.
* They sabotage a particular asset, making it fail at a moment of your choosing.
Roll +Sleight. On a hit, they do it. On a 7-9 the GM names a clue you leave behind, or a family or faction that sees through the deception.

Subterfuge is a great force multiplier for your other moves. Use the first option to get people to assist your Claim by Force, or use it after a Claim by Force to stop people taking your new asset back. Use the second to distract your rivals or create an opening for leadership change in your opponents. Use the third option to hide your own actions and let someone else take the fall for them, and use the fourth to sap your enemy’s strength – maybe something concrete like weaponry or armour, or something intangible like morale or critical thinking.

## Examples: Subterfuge

# Surplus and Need
Legacy is a system that doesn’t worry about keeping track of the precise details of your family’s wealth, health and happiness. You’re generally assumed to have just enough of any given commodity to get by. 
Sometimes this assumption is broken. If you have a surfeit of a resource – easily twice or more what you need to get by – you write it down as a Surplus. Surpluses can be spent to activate particular moves, and as long as you have one it boosts the quality of gear your characters can access (see XX).
Similarly, sometimes you don’t have enough of something and you’re suffering from the lack. You write these down as a Need. For as long as you have the Need, your family will be less able to handle adversity and the GM can use the Need to justify more severe consequences from your actions.
If a Need could be met by a Surplus, erase both.
If you gain a Surplus or Need you already have, gain a different one that everyone agrees is appropriate given the current circumstances.
If you roll 6- on a family move and have a relevant Need, the GM can make as severe a reaction as they like.
## FINDING A SURPLUS
When your family claims or creates a significant resource in the fiction, add it as a surplus.
## RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB
When your family uses their resources to confront a crisis, erase an appropriate surplus and mitigate or resolve the problem.

## Example Resources
This is the list of resources we used when designing Legacy, though you should feel free to make up your own to fit the situation - not all the ones listed here will be appropriate for every game.   
Read on to see what having each resource as a surplus or a need might look like.

# Mood
Your Mood measures your Family’s overall health, calculated as total number of Surpluses minus total number of Needs. 
Adjust Mood whenever your number of Surpluses or Needs changes. This will trigger special effects if this takes you above +3 or below -3:
## Flush with Resources
When Mood would go over +3, erase a Surplus and pick one:
* Sell off the excess for 1 Coin.
* Gift the excess to your allies. Gain advantage with Reach until the end of this Age.
* Make a show of power with a great celebration. Gain advantage with Grasp until the end of this Age.
* Finance a network of informants. Gain advantage with Sleight until the end of this Age.
* You invest in better equipment. Permanently unlock 1 more gear option.
You can only pick each option once per age.
## Fall into Crisis
When Mood would go below -3, erase a Need and pick one:
* Someone takes advantage of your weakness: lose an important alliance or territory.
* Your family falls into infighting. Get disadvantage with Grasp until the dispute is resolved.
* Your family retreats into solitude. Get disadvantage with Reach until they are convinced out of isolation.
* Your family loses discipline and your contacts smell weakness. Get disadvantage with Sleight until you make a display of might and drive.
* Your old tools fail you. Lose one gear option.
You can only pick each option once per age.

### Examples: Fall into Crisis

# Treaties
Your Family is an organisation with a key role in a homeland-spanning network of social influence based on respect, fear, and debts owed. This is measured in your Treaty score with other Families and organisations. 
Treaties represent soft power one family holds over another. The more treaties you have on someone, the more people will expect that faction to go along with your wishes. Treaty gains can be equitable or one-sided, but once a point of Treaty has been spent that obligation you hold over the other faction is gone for good.
Treaties encompass everything that a faction can draw on in negotiations: military sabre-rattling, shared cultural values, previous services one side provided to the other, or diplomatic clout with the other factions of the Homeland. When two Families meet at a negotiating table their treaties with each other give context to the discussion, and abstract their obligations to each other. 
To seal a deal you can choose to give Treaty to another Family, but once it’s given to them they can call on that obligation any time they wish. Each family also has an Alliance Move – a way to get Treaty on other groups when the move is triggered.
There are two things you can do with Treaty: help others and call in debts.
## Lend Aid 
When your Family throws its weight behind another, roll +Treaty with them. 
On a hit you give that Family’s next action advantage. 
On a 7-9 your Family is exposed to any danger, retribution or unforeseen consequences of their move.

## Call in a Debt
When you call on an obligation another Family has to you, spend 1 Treaty and choose one:
* Gain +2 on a move that targets them.
* Take a Surplus from them.
* Take 1 Coin from them.
* Get them to back you up, fall into indecision, or protect something important.
Player families can resist by spending 1-Treaty on you, or Holding Together if they have none.

# Expendable Resources
As your family takes action in the world, you’ll pick up two resources that are simpler in use: Coin and Insight. 
Coin represents the liquid assets available to your Family. It’s useful to make your family’s actions easier, and required to maintain your investments.
Insight represents your knowledge of the secret truths of the land. It might come from your scout’s reports, political networking, inherited lore or some other source. You spend it to reveal new features on the map, or unexpected strengths your characters can draw on.
As with Surpluses, you can freely give these to other players as part of trade agreements or as gifts. You don’t need to play out the transfer, so long as enough time is passing that could feasibly have happened.
## Speed the Wheels
When you use your wealth and resources to eliminate problems in your family’s way, spend 1-Coin to give a roll advantage.

Make sure that when you use Coin you colour your description of your Family’s actions to respect the wealth and extravagance you’re calling on.

## Uncover Secrets
When you gather your family’s specialists in council, roll +Insight spent. On a hit ask 1:
* “How do I get Surplus: __”,
* “How do I remove Need: __”,
* “What’s the truth behind __”
* “How can we best make use of __”. 
For each answer, add an appropriate detail to the map. 
On a 10+, ask a second question or add to the map one of: 
* A powder keg ready to explode.
* A place to shelter from harm. 
* A barrier that impedes travel.

With this move you’re either discovering something new, or giving an established part of the fiction a new role as you reveal how it’s secretly changed.

# Wonders
Sometimes your family will act on a scale even grander than the standard family moves. Making a permanent impact on the world takes a lot of time and effort, but can be well worth it. To do so, you’ll be using Wonders.
Each Wonder is a particular project; check Chapter XX for each project’s specific details. To construct it, you’ll need to look at its five requirements: surpluses that must be invested in the project for it to succeed. 

Whenever your family has a surplus that matches a requirement, you can immediately invest it. Erase the surplus, mark off that requirement, and describe what your Family does with that surplus to work towards the project’s completion. 

Your Family may build a Wonder slowly over many Ages, or assemble it in a frenzy of activity over a few months, but they always take enough time to put together that others have a chance to respond. 

The invested surpluses remain in the world, and are vulnerable to the actions of other players and the GM’s moves. If the fiction would suggest the project has been set back a step, the GM may tell you to erase your mark next to one or more requirements, meaning that you’ll have to invest that resource again. All the invested resources are erased if the project is stopped or killed.

As soon as the project is completed, every other Family must roll in the project’s specific Trials & Fortunes table. For all intents and purposes, this is a Turn of Age, with a new Age starting once it’s been resolved.

To determine the roll modifier, answer these:
* Does your family have one or more points of Treaty on the Owner of the Project? If so, take +1; if not, take -1.
* Does your family have one or more surpluses matching the Wonder’s Requirements? If so, take +1; if not, take -1. 
You can erase a matching surplus to get an extra +1 on this roll. 

On a miss take two Trials, on a 10+ take two Fortunes, and on a 7-9 take a Trial and a Fortune. You choose one of the Fortunes or Trials – the owner picks the second.

The owner of the Wonder doesn’t roll anything; they just reap the benefits and shape the narrative outcome of that wonder’s completion. For major Factions, the owner picks a Trial or Fortune of their choice. 

Each project leaves behind a monument that creates a continual benefit. These can provide an attractive target for other Families: in the event that another Family takes control of the Project’s remnant – via force of arms, social manoeuvring, or deception – it won’t provide a bonus to anyone for the remainder of the Age. At the start of the next Age, it will resume providing its benefits to its new owner.
