Arbiter Relationship
Close Ally \<\> Cordial Friendship \<\> Arbiter Oversight \<\> Distant Relationship \<\> Peripheral
(these do not imply any distance in Geography, a Close Ally family could be physically much further away than a Peripheral family)

Closer relationship with Arbiter allows you to make use of some of their resources as if they were your own, but requires contribution to the Aribter’s Project to maintain.
Further relationships let you exploit resources without oversight by the Arbiter, but you must use some means to resist being brought back under the influence.

How often? Broken up by seasons. Arbiter holds court/moves around, break up into season periods for play.
