Your character is an exceptional member of the Family, tasked with braving the wild and fractured world to find the things the Family needs. If they also find allies and opportunities to improve the Family’s standing, that’s all good. Characters have four stats:
* Might is your force and vigour. You roll +Might to Fiercely Assault your enemies.
* Bravery is your ability to make quick and decisive action in dangerous situations. You roll +Bravery to reduce danger and be nimble and athletic. 
* Cunning is your ability to understand others and get them on your side. You roll +Cunning to Find Common Ground with those you meet.
* Lore is your knowledge and connection to the land. You roll +Lore to Unleash Power from ancient rituals.

# Making a Character
To make a Character, start by choosing a playbook. As with Families, try and make sure each player uses a different one. Each playbook describes a particular kind of post-apocalyptic protagonist that you further customise by picking from a number of options. To read through the playbooks, check out Chapter 9.
Stats: What are your strengths versus the challenges of the wasteland? Pick an array, and get +1 to one of two stats according to your Family.
Looks: These define how you present yourself, and how others perceive you – your face, your eyes, your body, your gender presentation. 
Backstory: You’ve had past adventures and rivalries with the other characters. These experiences explain why you’re working together now.
Gear: Your Family will have stocks of gear you can draw on. Pick gear from this stockpile when you make your character, getting extra benefits from your character playbook and Surpluses.
Role: Pick a starting role (Leader, Agent, Rebel or Outsider) and work through its effects. Unlike when you mark roles in play, do not add 1 to the associated stat page \<OV\>.  
Playbook moves: Each playbook lets you choose two moves to customise your character’s particular specialties.
You have a free choice of names, but here are some ideas:
Ada, Anders, Angel, Brigit, Buffalo, Cant, Cato, Cloud, Elijah, Erwin, Eva, Firestone, Flame, Gil, Hive, Isis, It, Leo, Lin, Longshot, Louis, Lux, Makoto, Masud, Max, Moon, Nemo, Nora, Rebar, Silver, Sky, Smoke, Tadpole, Taliha, Wither, Xu

# Character Creation Example

# Core Character Moves
This land demands a certain set of skills from its heroes. These actions are available to all characters, though a character’s stats will determine how well it’s likely to go when they try to do them. When you activate a move’s fiction trigger, work through its mechanics and then return to the fiction, showing how it’s been altered by the move. 

Remember: to benefit from the move, you must meet its fiction trigger. Conversely, if you meet a move’s fiction trigger, you must carry out the rest of it. 

## Disarm
When you use quick action or heroics to de-escalate a dangerous situation, roll +Bravery. 
On a 7-9, you’ve bought some time, but choose one:
* The GM will demand a sacrifice to secure your safety.
* It’s only a temporary reprieve, and the danger will soon return.
* The danger’s still present but threatening someone or something else.

On a 10+ the situation is safe unless changed significantly. 
The world’s a dangerous place, but there’s often something you can do to make it safer. You trigger this move by taking some dramatic action to de-claw the threats assaulting you, get opponents to back down, escape the danger or reframe a conflict so that everyone can get what they want. 

A 10+ result takes the threat out of the picture until someone takes action to re-introduce it. If the player asks for a cost on a 7-9, the GM can demand that they sacrifice of some of their gear, they suffer harm, they make a binding promise to get someone to back down, or whatever else makes sense in the fiction. If a player’s rolling this, then the situation’s already charged, so you should have plenty of things to pick from to demand of them!

### Examples: Disarm

## Unleash Power
When you learn a ritual of the land, the GM will give you a few clues about what it can do. 
When you use the ritual, say a thing you want it to do based on the clues and roll +Lore. 
On a 7-9 pick two; on a 10+ pick three:


Magic is unpredictable: only the options you pick when you use the ritual definitely happen. The options you didn’t pick may happen, or may not – it’s up to the GM. 
GM note: even when a ritual doesn’t do what a player wants, rolling a 7+ should still improve their current situation.
The clues a GM gives aren’t absolute. A group has the ability to veto a player’s suggested function for a ritual, as they can for any suggestion, but it’s fine for a player to propose an effect that’s different from what the GM had in mind. 

### Examples: Unleash Power

## Fiercely Assault
When you use an appropriate weapon to hurt, capture or drive off your enemies, roll +Might. On a hit, you’ve achieved your goal – they’re wounded, bound or fleeing. 
On a 7-9, you choose one and the GM chooses two; on a 10+, you choose two and the GM chooses one.
**Character list:**
* Your avenue of escape is clear.
* You inflict savage, terrifying harm, frightening and dismaying your foes.
* You scavenge something valuable – gain a Device.
* You get information from your foes – get 1 Insight.
**GM list:**
* Something or someone important to you is harmed.
* Others will come after you.
* You take Harm appropriate to the enemy.
* The situation is destabilised and chaos will follow.

Combat in Free From the Yoke is about getting yourself into the right position to make full use of your weapon, and then rolling Fiercely Assault as you strike. A weapon’s tags make all the difference – a dagger (melee, hidden) needs a lot more finesse to threaten an army of soldiers than a trebuchet (ranged, area, brutal).
Combat’s also risky – notice that even if you roll as well as possible the GM can add their own consequences. The only safe way to hurt someone is if they’re already at your mercy.
The Armoury section on page XX goes into detail on the tags available, and how you build your weapons. 

### Examples: Fiercely Assault
## Find Common Ground
When you ask someone to work with you, roll +Cunning. On a hit they’ll do it if you meet their terms. On 7-9 their player picks two and both must be met, on a 10+ they pick one:
They’ll only do it if...
* …a third party vouches for you.
* …they can add or remove specific things to the task.
* …they can back out as soon as the task costs them anything.
* …you reduce the threat you pose to them.
* …you can give them something now that’s worth it.
* …you reveal your full agenda here.
* …their faction/family gets 1 Treaty on your Family.

It’s possible to pick options that have already been established explicitly or implicitly in the fiction. That’s absolutely fine: this move’s here to establish what it’ll take for you to work together, not to place barriers in the way of cooperation. Once terms have been set out, it’s perfectly fine for the instigator to back out. If they do so, though, they can’t use Find Common Ground again to try and get a better deal until they’re asking for help on a significantly different venture. 

### Examples: Find Common Ground

## Information is Power
When your character draws on your family’s knowledge and spends a point of Insight, reveal a secret they discovered about your target and get fleeting advantage exploiting it.

This is a catch-all bonus – it can boost any action that your family could conceivably have prepared you for. As you activate this, briefly say what detail of the situation your character is exploiting to get the bonus. Remember – advantage doesn’t stack. If you already have one source of it, this move won’t provide additional help.

## What about investigation?
Legacy assumes that your character’s attempts to investigate a situation will be handled by the conversation between the GM and the players, and maybe GM reactions. Remember that the GM gets to make reactions every time the players are looking to them to say what happens, and asking what happens when your character looks into a scene definitely counts! If you’re describing your character trying to find things out – lifting wreckage and searching for hidden treasure, for example – expect the GM to respond with one of the following:
Show an unwelcome truth. Example: The thing you’re looking for is here, but it’s busted or broken.
Offer an opportunity, with cost. Example: Yeah, you spot a way out, though it’ll take you past the guard’s line of sight.
Offer an opportunity, without cost. Example: As you glance around, you see a glowing screen poking out of the rubble – a piece of tech!
Show a remnant of the past, used in new ways. Example: As you get closer you see that the battlemech has been hollowed out, and a tarp stretches out from the central cavity to provide shelter. Someone’s living here.

# Peripheral Moves
These moves are available to all characters but are more situational or more optional, usable according to taste.
## Familiar Face
When you look for old friends in a new settlement, roll +Cunning. On a hit, you find someone; on a 7-9 pick two, on a 10+ pick 3:
* You don’t owe them.
* They’re influential in the settlement.
* They’re not tied up in their own crisis.
* They’re already interested in your current predicament.

It doesn’t need to be a completely new settlement – just one that we haven’t seen this character in ‘on-screen’ during the game.
### Examples: Familiar Face

## Forge a Path
When you find a way across precarious or dangerous terrain, roll +Bravery. On a hit you make it to your destination, but on a 7-9 pick two, on a 10+ pick one:
* You’re exposed to danger as you travel.
* The route you took is lost.
* You can’t take gear/other characters with you.
* You take a lot longer than you expected.
### Examples: Forge a path

## Unearth Forgotten Lore
When you uncover a landmark or custom from the past, roll +Lore. 
On a 7+, gain 1 Insight. On 7-9 ask 1; on a 10+, ask 3:
* Whose ancestors are most tied to it?
* What was it made to remember?
* How can I draw on this for power?
### Example: unearth forgotten lore

## Duel
When you face down a matched foe in single combat, roll +Might. On a 7-9 hold 1, on a 10+ hold 2.
When your opponent is a PC, they roll Might and gain hold as above.
When your opponent is a GMC, they gain 1 hold if they are:
* A fearsome and powerful fighter.
* Equipped with impressive arms or sorceries.
* Avenging a grudge.

As you duel, you and your opponents take it in turns to describe your actions and then pick a statement from the list below. Keep taking turns until the duel is over.

* I desperately hunker behind my defences. Do you press the attack, or recover your breath?
* I charge in heedless of your attacks. I take a flesh wound; yield, or take a flesh wound.
* I try to put space between us. Do you sprint heedlessly after me, or advance carefully?

Gain 1 Hold by picking one of these:
* I test your defences. Fall back, or reveal your full capabilities.
* I feint and you falter. Yield, or look foolish in front of our audience.
* I make an appeal for reason. Yield, or show how this must end in blood.

Spend 1 Hold to pick one of these:
* I get my weapon inside your guard. Yield, or take a flesh wound.
* I strike at your armaments. Yield, or I knock away a weapon or a piece of your armour.
* I take advantage of your existing wounds. Yield, or I either turn a flesh wound into a heavy wound, or turn a heavy wound into a deadly wound.
* I discover a second wind, and step down my most severe wound. Yield, or tell me what you most fear I’ll do next.

## Learn a Ritual
When you learn a ritual, roll +Lore. On a 7-9, your tutor picks two conditions; on a 10+ they pick one.
* You cannot use the ritual in a certain set of circumstances.
* You cannot use the ritual to affect a certain set of people.
* You must conduct yourself according to a particular virtue.
* You are forbidden from carrying out a particular action.
* Once a season, you must perform a particular action.
* You cannot teach the ritual to others.

If you break the condition, you cannot use the ritual any more until you gain the permission of the tutor.
If you learn a ritual without a tutor (eg from Unearth Forgotten Lore), your tutor is the land itself.

# Character Roles
Your Character has a particular Role in their Family: Leader, Champion, Rebel or Outsider. When they work with their Family, their Role will colour the effect that has.
The goal with Roles is to provide you with more tools to describe the relationship between character and family. These set out what situations in the fiction might lead your character to take on new roles, and help you describe the consequences.
## Changing Role
Each playbook has their own triggers to move between the different roles when specific events occur in the fiction. These work in both directions: if you want to become a leader you have to work through its consequences in the fiction, and if the events in the fiction put your character in a position of responsibility you have to mark leader.
## Character Advancement
When you mark an unmarked role, get a new move or add 1 to a stat.
If you mark each role, your character retires to safety. Narrate an epilogue for them, using any element you like from their Death move, and then create a new character to carry on their legacy.
Versatility is strength! The more life experience a character has, the more tools they’ll have at their disposal – and the better they’ll be at using them. And if you can work your way through each role, you’ll have the opportunity to work great changes to the world on your own terms before your character fades into the background and lets new heroes step forward.
# Hostile Grounds and Harm
The wilderness can be a tough place to survive in. As you face down its dangers you can get sliced up, infected with plagues, sent into despair or face stranger wounds besides. These threats can affect you in a few different ways.
## Hostile Grounds
First, there’s Hostile Grounds. The wilderness on the fringes of the land contains innumerable hazards: the depths of the ocean, the ice-encrusted peaks, or blighted swamps where only strange beasts can survive.
When in a hostile environment, you roll with disadvantage. To overcome this disadvantage, find specific gear or use strange rituals.
If you’re adapted to your environment and acting against someone who would roll with disadvantage, roll with advantage.
There’s no hard and fast rule for when disadvantage comes into play, but remember it’s the environment itself you should be considering. If you wouldn’t expect to be able to survive there without special equipment or training, it’s definitely Hostile. If the only reason you’d be imperilled is because of monsters or raiders, probably not. 
## Harm
Disadvantage is a good way of expressing how a dangerous environment makes everything more risky, but active threats to life and limb need a more lasting impact. For these we use Harm – physical, mental, emotional or spiritual trauma. Harm comes in three ranks:
* Flesh Wounds: These wounds sting, but you’re able to push through them. 
	* Examples: Angry, Bruised, Sprained, Stressed, Winded.
* Heavy Wounds: These wounds demand attention. Each wound penalises one of your stats, giving you Disadvantage using it. 
	* Examples: Broken bones, feverish, hallucinating, cursed.
* Deadly Wounds: Deadly wounds kill you - if not now, then by the close of the day.
	* Examples: gut wound, poisoned, etc.

These are the moves you’ll mainly use to clear out your harm boxes:
## Shake It Off
When you take cover or put space between you and a threat, heal any flesh wound. The GM says how the situation changes while you’re distracted. 
When you have a few hours of peace, heal all minor harm boxes.
## Professional Care
When you rest a few weeks in safety with access to a relevant Surplus, heal all Heavy Wounds. The GM says how the local area changes while you’re being treated.
## Death
Sometimes the dangers of this land are too much to overcome.
When you take a Deadly wound, trigger your playbook’s Death Move. Once that’s resolved, your character is no longer playable. 
Choose one of your character’s moves and link it to one of your possessions as a relic. Any member of your Family holding that relic is able to use that move, for the rest of history.
Make a new character from a different playbook. The GM will work to bring you in to the story as soon as makes sense.

## Eulogy
When you die, what will the world know of your life? Who will tell your legends? 
When you bring a character’s relic back to their family, you may spend time with them telling and being told stories of the deceased character’s life and final moments. If you do, the family’s player picks one:
* Their family gives your family 2-Treaty.
* Your character counts as a member of their family – mark a role representing this new relationship.
* Their next Character swears to perform a task of your choosing.
