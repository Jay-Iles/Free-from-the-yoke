## Arbiter Projects
A list of projects:

# Claiming Territory
The Land isn't big enough for the Arbiter's ambitions. Bit by bit or in one grand annexation, they mean to swell their nation's size.
## Foundation
Go around the table, answering these questions in turn:
* What region is the Arbiter looking to claim?
* Where have expeditions been launched from?
* What riches have expeditions already discovered?
* What’s the source of the problems? Existing inhabitants, a dangerous crossing, hostile geography?
## Entanglement
*Required Surpluses:* Scouts, Transport, Trade, Morale, Recruits, Spies.

Increase this project’s doom track when:
* An expedition is lost or goes rogue.
* A new threat appears in the new region.
* Travellers to the new region encounter new difficulties.
* 

## Resolution
When this project hits 5 Progress, the annexation is complete. The GM draws the Land’s new borders on the map. Each player chooses one:
* You claim a vast section of the new land. Gain Surplus: Land and raise Grasp by 1.
* You claim a valuable resource site. Gain Surplus: Rare Materials and 5 Coin.
* You control travel to the new region. Erase Surplus: Transport to gain 5 Coin and get 2 Treaty on each House that colonises the new region.
* You agitate for the rights of the new land’s inhabitants. Gain Surplus: Justice and 2 Treaty on the inhabitants, but lose 1-Favour.
* You learn something surprising in the new land. Gain a House move from a playbook that isn’t in play, and add a new ritual to your House’s lore.
* Your explorers travel far and wide. Gain 1 Reach and 5 Insight.

If, instead, the project hits 5 Doom, the expedition is abandoned.
