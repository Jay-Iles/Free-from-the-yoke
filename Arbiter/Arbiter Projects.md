A list of projects:

# Claiming Territory
The Land isn't big enough for the Arbiter's ambitions. Bit by bit or in one grand annexation, they mean to swell their nation's size.
## Foundation
Go around the table, answering these questions in turn:
* What region is the Arbiter looking to claim?
* Where have expeditions been launched from?
* What riches have expeditions already discovered?
* What’s the source of the problems? Existing inhabitants, a dangerous crossing, hostile geography?
## Entanglement
*Required Surpluses:* Scouts, Transport, Trade, Morale, Recruits, Spies.

Increase this project’s doom track when:
* An expedition is lost or goes rogue.
* A new threat appears in the new region.
* Travellers to the new region encounter new difficulties.
*
