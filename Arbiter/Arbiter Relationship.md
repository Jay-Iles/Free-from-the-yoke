# Closeness to the court
The Arbiter holds sway over the nation. From their court they issue decrees, work on grand projects, and try to corrall the families of the land to serve their goals.
Your family may be anything from a trusted confidente of the Arbiter to a pariah on the fringes of society. Note that these do not imply any distance in Geography. A Close Ally could be physically much further away manning the nation's borders, while a Peripheral family could be right next to the court but be below their interest.

## The Scale
Your favour is somewhere on this 5-step scale:
* +2: Close Ally
* +1: Cordial Friendship
* 0: Arbiter Oversight
* -1: Distant Relationship
* -2: Peripheral

Every family starts at 0.

## Changing Favour
*To raise your favour,* give the Arbiter one of the surpluses they need for their project (see Arbiter Projects).

*To reduce your favour,* simply say you're doing so. 

*Each time your favour drops,* your Family's fortunes wane; trigger **Hold Together**.

*Each time you ask for the aid of the Arbiter's Hand,* your Favour moves one step towards 0 (see Arbiter Characters).

## Holding Court
*At the beginning of each season,* the Arbiter calls on each Family of note to serve them. Roll +Favour.
On a 6-, you're beneath their notice. They don't demand anything of you, but others see your isolation: lose 1-Treaty on each other faction. The GM says what faction is taking your place in the court.

On a 7-9, they have something they need from you. The GM picks one:
* They wish you to remove a particular threat.
* They wish you to solve a particular mystery.
* They wish you to convince a particular faction to aid the regime.
* They wish you to acquire a particular resource for the regime.
If you do it by the end of the season, gain 1-Favour. Otherwise, lose 1-Favour.

On a 10+, you are given trusted access to a part of their regime. The GM gives you control over one or more Surpluses invested in their Project, and tells you what the Arbiter wants done with them this season. If you do it, gain 1-Favour; if you fail at it, lose 1-Favour and the Surpluses.
