# The Arbiter's Agent
## Building a character
Each age, the group picks one of these archetypes for the Arbiter’s most trusted agent: Fist, Pen, Shadow, Soul, or Legs.
The agent starts with a simple statline and a bonus move, based on their archetype.

## Playing the Arbiter’s Agent
Each time play zooms in, the viewpoint player can ask for the Arbiter’s aid. If the Arbiter agrees, their agent is part of the play group: one other player takes control of them as if they were a Quick Character. In recompense, the viewpoint player's Family moves one step toward 0 on the Favour track (see arbiter favour).

When you play the Arbiter’s agent, the GM will give you an additional goal from your higher-ups. This goal should not directly conflict with the viewpoint player’s. 
## Advancement
Each time the Arbiter’s Agent returns from an expedition, the player controlling them should pick one option from their archetype's advancement list. Each option can only be chosen once.
