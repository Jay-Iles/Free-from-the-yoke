# Building a character
Each age, the group picks one of these archetypes for the Arbiter’s most trusted agent: 
## Fist
One who solves problems directly, ready to bash heads, or maybe content just exuding threat
Might 1; Lore -1

## Pen
One who is always ready to help, sending aid when desperately needed, or sage advice if it can be heard
Cunning 1; Might -1

## Shadow
One who operates behind the scenes, travelling unseen, perhaps with a dagger in hand
Cunning 1; Bravery -1

## Soul
One who knows of Magic and Artefacts more than most
Lore 1; Might -1

## Legs
Knows the ways and paths of the land and the sea
Bravery 1; Cunning -1
 
# Playing the Arbiter’s Agent
Each time play zooms in, the viewpoint player can ask for the Arbiter’s aid. If the Arbiter agrees, the agent is part of the play group: one other player takes control of them as if they were a Quick Character.
When you play the Arbiter’s agent, the GM will give you an additional goal from your higher-ups. This goal should not directly conflict with the viewpoint player’s. 
# Advancement
Each time the Arbiter’s Agent returns from an expedition, the player controlling them should pick one option from this list. Each option can only be chosen once.
