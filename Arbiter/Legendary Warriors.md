# Legendary Warriors
Strength, discipline, might and daring - these are the only things you can be sure of. Trust in them, and nothing in the world can stop you.

## Origins
* Ancient: For as long as the Land remembers, the Warriors have defended it. During the occupation they were mentors and assassins; now, they demand obedience so that they may teach the Houses how to be strong. They are small in number, but their agents cannot truly die unless bested in a fair **Duel**.
* Insurgent: After the occupation, the Warriors formed as a guerrilla army striking from the shadows. As the insurgency grew sub-chapters spread the light of revolution to each province. Now each region of the land is commanded by a faction of the Warriors, and they remain fully aware of the movement of troops within their particular domain. 
* Uprising: As the Houses rose up in open rebellion, their greatest generals formed a council of warlords. The council still commands the land, unwilling to relinquish its power. Their strategic acumen is still incredible; any opponent that challenges them in **Pitched Battle** must mark a fate as true even before battle is joined.

## Flashpoints

	* Volunteer answers: Who did you need help dealing with? Rebels, bandits, remnants of the empire, raiders, something else?

## Traditions	
The GM picks one option from each category.
### Style
Gleaming armour and engraved weaponry. 
Austere uniforms and utilitarian gear. 
Each hero uniquely outfitted in their adventure’s spoils.
Simple clothing and impeccable weaponry.

### Ceremonies
A duel between two pledges, as much a dance as a fight.
A chaotic, enthusiastic melee before a baying crowd.
A sombre service 	honouring those who died in revolution.
A grand feast lauding the Warrior’s leading generals.

### Laws
Each House must tithe some of those that come of age to serve as the Arbiter’s soldiers.
Any request of food or shelter from our soldiers must be heeded.
No house may raid another without our blessing.

## Agenda: Be the Tyrant they test themselves against
You are defined by your strength. Through your force of arms and strategic brilliance the war was won. You were beloved and honoured with the highest office in the land. But the skills that excel in war are not the ones required for peace. When a crisis strikes, you’ll deal with it like a military threat: identify an enemy, rally the troops to fight it, and crush all dissent within your ranks.
### Impulses:
Show a land kept safe by your cage.
Reward service with glory.
Applaud audacity and daring.
When your authority is challenged, escalate force.
## Moves
Pick one:
Patron of the Blade
At the beginning of each season, the GM picks which House holds the best warrior in the land. That House rolls Holding Court with Advantage.
Iron Discipline
Uniforms and drills keep the Arbiter’s soldiers united and cool-headed in even the most dire situations - but that also leaves them unquestioning. When anyone with positive Favour tries to manipulate the Arbiter’s soldiers, they roll Subterfuge with Advantage.
### Hail Caesar
When a House leads a successful military campaign outside the land’s borders, the Arbiter will celebrate their return and grant them Surplus: Prestige, Luxury or Leadership.
### The Cavalry Arrives
When a House misses a Claim by Force roll within your borders, the GM may use their reaction to declare the arrival of the Arbiter’s forces. Resolve the move like they rolled a 10+, but the leader of the company will say why the Arbiter sent them.
## Inheritance
Add 1 to your Agent’s starting Might or Bravery. Also, pick an Inheritance move for them:
* Legate: When in territory you control, you automatically get a 10+ on Familiar Face.
* Duellist: You are trained for single combat. When you Duel, gain 1 Hold every time you take a wound.
* Well-Equipped: When you dress for war, add a tag to your weaponry and your outfit.
* Hardy: The first time each day you take Harm, reduce it by 1.
