Traditions
Rule: The mightiest always rule; a council of clans; the line of princes has been unbroken for a century
Populace: Every citizen is mounted, ready for war; the clans are spread across the whole steppe to seek their means of life; once nomadic, the people still sustain themselves off the land wherever they go
Culture: Boisterous and warlike, but always welcoming in peacetime; the trophies of our enemies adorn saddle and abode; now settled we have adopted the best ways and practices of those we fought in past generations

Landmarks
Ancient (from history long ago, when your people first came to where they now reside)
The Field of Bones, where the dead will not stay buried long
A single, solitary barrow of a long-dead warlord
The dried-up spring, where the family clans first met to discuss politics

Imperial (from not long ago, when the land was still occupied by a foreign Empire)
The racing track that the Empire built to display the might of the horses it stole from your people
The governor’s mansion, built of brick and stone in threat and defiance against your old traditions
The beacons, to signal the family to prepare for the Empire’s wars

New (the first expression of independence)
The Great Stables, such that fully half of the family’s horses might be stabled there
The Long Flats, where your people first gathered for a new war against the Empire
The Farthest River, which under the Empire was beyond the bounds of your lands, but now barely the edge of what you might explore

History
How did the Empire treat your state?

Which family did you war with again and again before the Empire came?

Which strange far-off land did the Empire send your horsemen to fight in and what lessons did they bring back from that war?

Which family brought you new stock to strengthen your breeds?



Doctrine

The Freedom of the Saddle
Ride Fast to Any Summons

Lifestyle
Nomadic Remnants - although your family now has a city as its home, the steppes all around you still support many nomad kin-clans.
Settled Knights - now each of your famed horsemen is supported by land to supply food and horses so that they may focus on being the best.
The Finest Mercenaries - taught by the Empire to be soldiers, your family now works as a great mercenary company, trading your warlike might for resources the city needs.
