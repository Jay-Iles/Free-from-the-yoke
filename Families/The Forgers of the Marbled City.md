Traditions
Rule: The King sits in rule over all else with an iron fist, supported by the nobility; two noble houses vie for power across the centuries supported by popular movements; the Guild is the secret power behind the throne and successive Princes are but puppets
Populace: Great opportunities await any who can show their talent in craft while others toil in the fields; nobility can be attained, or purchased, for those who wish to rise through the ranks; the people wield the true power and a revolt can always topple and re-establish order
Culture: Great opulence is highly prized and everyone is adorned with some kind of jewellery; the carving of sculptures was once perfected by the Forgers and now the statues and carvings are seen everywhere; the clothes of crafters mark them out as love and prized and all else must adhere to strict codes
