Traditions
Rule: The council of elders; the Grandmaster rules all; three elected from the wisest of the house
Populace: The educated elites rise above the dirt and poverty of the farmers; even the lowliest must learn something of the wisdom of ages past but must be haunted by the knowledge; crafty feudal landlords control the land, its people and its resources, yet they are guided to use it wisely
Culture: The Ancient art and clothes still hold true even against the advance of time; old is new and new is old and the ways of your people are strange and modern to others; the culture of the Empire was a good disguise, still adopted
