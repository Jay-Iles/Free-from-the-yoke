# The Brethren of the Sea Serpent
Ancient myths talk of great sea serpents and other creatures of the sea that were tamed once. They may have long died out, but a legacy lives on in those who live by the sea and look out to the waves for guidance. Restless, brash and adventurous, the Brethren of the Sea Serpent always seek something to do and goals to pursue, sometimes perhaps unthinking of the consequences. This fluidity can create interesting situations, as action and progress may satisfy one of the Brethren only so long as it is in play and then something else, anything, must be found.
## Stats
* Reach 3, Grasp 0, Sleight -1 if your ancestors were the explorers who first found this land.
* Reach 2, Grasp -1, Sleight 1 if your ancestors were everyday folk who turned to a seafaring life to escape persecution.

## Traditions
### Rule: 
The Captains’ Table; The Admiral elected among those who hold a ship; 3 Ancient Houses rule according to traditional codes
### Populace:
Every citizen knows their way around a ship, whether to sail it or to build it; Though the sailors are the pride of the state, it is built upon the strong backbone of labourers who are valued above all; the word of any captain is worth above any serf or merchant, but few can hope to attain such rank
### Culture: 
A little taken from each corner of the land as fashions and curiosities are brought back home; to survive at sea you must be practical, and so the clothes and art of the Brethren follow; the old tales of the sea serpents still instill a fear and wonder that is reflected in everything made by the Brethren.

## Landmarks
### Ancient
* An old longboat haunted by warriors from the past.
* A decaying island fortress, accessible only by water or during low tide.

* The Empty Pens - did these once house giant sea serpents that your ancestors rode to battle?

### Imperial
* The great lighthouse of Imperial architecture, an eyesore upon beloved land and sea.
* The Hundred Wharfs, not long ago used to build a navy worthy of an Emperor.
* The cliffside keep, boldly watching against the only safe harbour for leagues.
* The sunken flagship, a reminder to the Empire to stay away so long as the Brethren draw breath.

### New

## History
*How did the Empire treat your house?* If you were criminals or outcasts, start at Favour +1. If you profited under their rule, start at Favour -1, but pick 3 Surpluses in the Resource section. 

*Which house did an ancient ruler of your house form a blood-pact with?* Gain 1-Treaty on each other.

*The Empire used your sailors to carry their explorers to unknown lands.* What strange powers did the Empire bargain with there?

*What atrocity was your house complicit in during the occupation?* Say which other house suffered from your actions, and give them 2-Treaty on you.

## Doctrine
* **Safe at sea:** You find peace away from land. Your House and Character gain advantage on all rolls to resist adversity while at sea.
* **Strange new lands:** Once each season, you may send a new expedition off in a direction of your choice. At the start of the next season, the GM will tell you what they found, and add a landmark to the map.
* **Dry land bars no Serpent ship:** Light hulls and genius carpentry make your ships easily transportable over land. With a few hour’s work a crew can change a boat’s *water* tag to a *land* tag, or vice versa.

## Lifestyle
* **Coastal towns:** Each one of your settlements is on the sea coast or the banks of a river. Any resource or asset in one of your holdings can be moved to any other within a few days. 
* **Rule at sea:** Your house is governed from a great vessel that cannot be easily pinned down. Any attempts to locate or trap this ark have Disadvantage.
* **Safe port in a storm:** Your house’s holdings are crowded around a great harbour, overlooked by an impressive fortress. Within the harbour, you can repair any damage to a vessel in a matter of days.
