Ancient myths talk of great sea serpents and other creatures of the sea that were tamed once. They may have long died out, but a legacy lives on in those who live by the sea and look out to the waves for guidance. Restless, brash and adventurous, the Brethren of the Sea Serpent always seek something to do and goals to pursue, sometimes perhaps unthinking of the consequences. This fluidity can create interesting situations, as action and progress may satisfy one of the Brethren only so long as it is in play and then something else, anything, must be found.

Traditions
Rule: The Captainsâ€™ Table; The Admiral elected among those who hold a ship; 3 Ancient Houses rule according to traditional codes
Populace: Every citizen knows their way around a ship, whether to sail it or to build it; Though the sailors are the pride of the state, it is built upon the strong backbone of labourers who are valued above all; the word of any captain is worth above any serf or merchant, but few can hope to attain such rank
Culture: A little taken from each corner of the land as fashions and curiosities are brought back home; to survive at sea you must be practical, and so the clothes and art of the Brethren follow; the old tales of the sea serpents still instill a fear and wonder that is reflected in everything made by the Brethren
