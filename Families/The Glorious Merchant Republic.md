# The Glorious Merchant Republic
## Stats
* Reach 3, Grasp 0, Sleight -1
* Reach 1, Grasp -1, Sleight 2
* Reach 2, Grasp 0, Sleight 0

## Traditions
**Rule:** Fair and measured hand of the elite; predatory and cut-throat dog-eat-dog; open and accessible to its citizens
**Populace:** Great inequality of rich merchants and poor serfs; build upon towns of trade and commerce but with little cultivable land; prideful of being the only truly free people
**Culture:** Practical and meek, favouring only what is necessary; careful craft and diligent work above all else; extravagant style often hides a cold and calculating approach

## Landmarks
### Ancient
* A stone circle, once a meeting place, now overgrown with weeds
* A tall stele, seemingly too fragile to support itself, yet standing since time immemorial
* A dark and brooding bog, often misted, always shunned

### Imperial
* The Great Markets, once siphoning the craft of the state to far-off lands for the Empireâ€™s profit
* A field of muster, where the Empire used its military to cow your state into submission
* The old town-house, where those chafing under the rule of the Empire used to meet

### New
* The Senate House, from where the Republic is ruled in independence
* The Way of the People, a long and busy road where most of the trade traffic starts or ends their journey
* The five districts of the Republic, from each the rulers drawn and creating the division of voting and franchise

## History
* How did the Empire treat your state?
* Which house was the ancient trading partner before the Empire came?
* Which new land of boundless opportunity did the Empire teach you of, and who from it now lives within your state?
* Which house do you now rely on to be an effective trader?

## Doctrine
* Know The True Nature of Your Partners
* Trade with Four Corners
* Supply the Needy

## Lifestyle
* **The Merchant City:** Power and the nexus of trade is concentrated within one city. It is walled and defensible, able to attract the best from all around. Your ability to trade cannot be disrupted as long as the City stands.
* **A Network of Towns:** Through the cooperation of several towns in the state, the house is flexible, easily able to expand and grow in different directions, choosing many new partners and trade-routes. The loss of one town may be a blow, but the others will carry on the work.
* **A Branch in Every State:** Your house has long moved beyond the concern of just one city, spreading tendrils into every nearby state. This means at least cordial relations with all the nearby state and the ability to find some common ground with them.
