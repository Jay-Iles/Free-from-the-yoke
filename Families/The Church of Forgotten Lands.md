Traditions
Rule: The Prince is the anointed ruler of God(s), governing with divine mandate and support of the Church; the rule is shared between the Lords Temporal and the Lords Spiritual in uneasy balance, the people often caught in the feuds; though Princes have reigned before, now the Archbishop and those appointed by the Church hold power
Populace: People in every walk of life are God-fearing to the last, the trust in the Church is absolute; the priesthood works tirelessly to minister to the poor and downtrodden, so that the worst of excesses of the nobles and merchants are tempered and held back; fully half the population live in monasteries, mastering craft as well as prayer
Culture: Austere yet bold, the arts flourish under the guidance of the Church; the happiness and wonder of life is celebrated in the many extravagant clothes and customs; no expenses are spared decorating churches and all forms of religious art continue to blossom
